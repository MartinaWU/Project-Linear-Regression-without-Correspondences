# Course Project: Linear Regression without Correspondences
Wu Fan
# This Project invites students to implement several algorithms, including
- Brute force,
- RANSAC,
- Alternating Minimization,
- Robust Regression,
- The algebraic method,  
and explore their limitations in solving the problem of Linear Regression without Correspondences. We provide MATLAB starting code for this homework.
Pdf version has all the code and answer for hw(with a formula latex error,just can't show correctly)
md version is easy to read(with no latex error)
jupyter notebook you can run all the code
they are same
